In this project components were used because they are reusable. The data/animals.js was created to store the animals information and mainly be imported in where its used which is the pages.
the file also makes it easier to add more animals.
the handlers should also be passed down to the child component by using props. I decided to use react routing to make navigation easier.
the MainLayout has a shared used interface, so now theres no need to import components like header and footer on every single page. because the header and nav are now stored thin the layout.
